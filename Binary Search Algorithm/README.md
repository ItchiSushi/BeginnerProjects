<h1>Binary Search Algorithm</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p align = "justify">This program demonstrates a basic binary search operation by recursion using a while loop. The while loop will loop through a list/Array using start, middle, and end variables which will split the list to pin point the target value. The while loop will also keep track of the steps it took to find the target value.</p>
